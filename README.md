# KNN-FROM-SCRATCH
KNN Implementation from Scratch
This repository contains the implementation of the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch using Python.

Contents:
Jupyter Notebook:

File name: KNN_From_Scratch.ipynb
Description: This notebook explains the basic and important features of the KNN algorithm. It serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the inner workings of KNN.
Dataset:

File name: social_network_dataset.csv
Description: The dataset used in applying the KNN algorithm. It's named the social network dataset.
Results:
Upon applying the KNN algorithm to this dataset, we achieved an accuracy of 92.5%. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the implemented algorithm. Feel free to use this repository for better understanding and experimentation.
